# 🐈copyCat🐈

## copyCat is copying you!
Anything you insert in the text field, copyCat will copy you (as his name implies.) However, by clicking on copyCat you can put tape over his mouth and he'll no longer be able to copy you. It gets annoying after a while and also I thought cats don't talk? Hmm.

Built this silly little app to practice passing props and using states in React components. Since it's React, run this in your terminal and you should find the app running at `http://localhost:3000`: `npm start`

Happy coding! -from Vic
